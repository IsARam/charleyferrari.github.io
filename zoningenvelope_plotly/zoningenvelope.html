      <p>This zoning envelope map shows the number of land plots that have the potential to be expanded.
      Building heights are defined by FAR, or floor to area ratio. Assuming the building footprint uses the
      full plot area, this is just the number of floors that can potentially be built above what currently
      exists. By using the drop down menu below, you can choose to filter the map by number of available
      floors. If you would like to only view buildings that can grow by more than 4 floors, choose 4.</p>
